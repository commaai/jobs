Our mission is to **solve self driving cars while delivering shippable intermediaries**.

We're building the robotics stack that will solve self driving cars, then eventually scales to all of robotics. We own our stack from shipping state of the art [machine learning models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAWScxZuc0g&pp=ygUQY29tbWEgY29uIGhhcmFsZA%3D%3D) trained on our own [infrastructure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJWsrPnfrgo), building the [operating system](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot), designing the [hardware](https://blog.comma.ai/comma3X/), and [manufacturing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-jdEgvLb-A) it.

Today, our fleet is the second largest after Tesla, and it's growing every month as more of the 10+ million compatible cars on the road come online. We will win by continuing to ship a better product and better driving to our users. No hype, just shipping constant incremental progress until your comma reliably drives you to [Taco Bell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUIZYzxtMQs&t=4s&pp=ygUPY29tbWEgdGFjbyBiZWxs).

All jobs are on site in San Diego, CA. One meeting a week, two great meals a day, and solving self driving cars.

Perks:
* Chef-prepared lunch and dinner
* On-site gym and yoga studio
* 24/7 access to the comma fleet of cars
* Health, dental, and vision insurance
* Flexible time off

### Applying

**1. Technical challenge**
Choose any of the challenges below, solve it, then email your solution to work@comma.ai.

**2. Phone screen**
Typically, we do two phone calls. A quick intro and screen, then an in-depth technical interview with a division head.

**3. Paid Micro-internship**
We'll fly you out to meet the team and work on a real problem for a few days. In most cases, the project will be scoped such that you'll ship it to real users by the end.

If all goes well, we'll make you a full-time job offer.

### Challenges

We're actively hiring anyone who can do these challenges well; ML, web, systems, product, designers, and electrical engineers.
* [design](design.md): design a UI to communicate openpilot's confidence to the user
* [controls](https://github.com/commaai/controls_challenge): build a controller to steer a (simulated) car
* [paid bounties](https://github.com/orgs/commaai/projects/26): get a bounty merged to one of our open source projects

## FAQ

* **Internship?** All teams accept interns year-round. The process is the same, except the micro-internship is a full internship.
* **Remote work?** No, all jobs are on site in San Diego.
* **Any specific requirements?** Nope. We're just looking for people who do well on our challenges and can independently contribute to shipping openpilot to users.
* **Any other jobs?** We're hiring a technician for our compute cluster and a pick and place operator. Instead of a challenge submission, these jobs simply require relevant experience.
* **Are you hiring for X?** If you can do any of the challenges well, then we're probably interested.
* **Do you offer Visa sponsorship?** Yes, with rare country specific exceptions.
